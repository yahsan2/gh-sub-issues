A GitHub CLI extension for managing sub-issues (child issues). Create hierarchical task structures by linking issues as parent-child relationships.

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 **Link existing issues** - Connect existing issues as sub-issues to a parent issue
- ➕ **Create sub-issues** - Create new issues directly linked to a parent
- 📋 **List sub-issues** - View all sub-issues connected to a parent issue
- 🎨 **Multiple output formats** - Support for TTY (colored), plain text, and JSON output
- 🔄 **Cross-repository support** - Work with issues across different repositories

## 📦 Installation

```bash
gh extension install yahsan2/gh-sub-issue
```

### Requirements

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) 2.0.0 or later
- GitHub account with appropriate repository permissions

## 🚀 Usage

### Add existing issue as sub-issue

Link an existing issue to a parent issue:

```bash
# Using issue numbers
gh sub-issue add 123 456

# Using URLs
gh sub-issue add https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 456

# Cross-repository
gh sub-issue add 123 456 --repo owner/repo
```

### Create a new sub-issue

Create a new issue directly linked to a parent:

```bash
# Basic usage
gh sub-issue create --parent 123 --title "Implement user authentication"

# With description and labels
gh sub-issue create --parent 123 \
  --title "Add login endpoint" \
  --body "Implement POST /api/login endpoint" \
  --label "backend,api" \
  --assignee "@me"

# Using parent issue URL
gh sub-issue create \
  --parent https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 \
  --title "Write API tests"
```

### List sub-issues

View all sub-issues linked to a parent issue:

```bash
# Basic listing
gh sub-issue list 123

# Show all states (open, closed)
gh sub-issue list 123 --state all

# JSON output for scripting
gh sub-issue list 123 --json

# Using URL
gh sub-issue list https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
```
